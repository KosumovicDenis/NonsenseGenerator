Welcome to **NonsenseGenerator**, a playful and creative application designed to generate quirky, unexpected sentences based on random grammatical structures. Whether you're a writer looking for prompts, a developer exploring language generation, or just someone in need of a good chuckle — this tool is for you.

> *NonsenseGenerator app – Where grammar meets absurdity.*

NonsenseGenerator takes simple text input and turns it into wild, sometimes poetic nonsense using structured templates, a randomized dictionary, and optional syntax trees. It features an easy-to-use graphical interface, a customizable wordbank, and a history of all your generated gems.
