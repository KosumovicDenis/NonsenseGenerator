## Syntactic tree visualization

|Use case ||
| -------- | ------- |
| User Story | **As a** user, **I want** the option to visualize the syntactic tree of a sentence, **so that** I can understand and validate its grammatical structure. |
| Description| A user can visualize the syntactic tree of the given sentence to check its grammar. |
| Acceptance Criteria | **Given** I’m on the Random Sentence Generator app **And** a sentence is displayed in the output area **When** I click the “Visualize syntactic tree” button **Then** the system renders a syntactic tree diagram for that sentence |


| Test case ||
| -------- | ------- |
| Actor |User|
| Expected Result | When I click the "get syntactic tree" checkbox and then click the submit button the application returns a tree view with nouns, verbs and adjectives of the input sentence, categorized |
| Result | When I check the "get syntactic tree" checkbox and then click the submit button, the application returns a tree view with nouns, verbs and adjectives of the input sentence |
| Test State | **Passed ✅** |

## Generation based on user input

|Use case ||
| -------- | ------- |
| User Story | **As a** user, **I want** to provide a sentence, **so that** the generated output is based on the supplied input |
| Description| A user can provide an input and have an output derived from it |
| Acceptance Criteria | **Given** I’m on the Random Sentence Generator app **And** I have entered a sentence into the “Input phrase” field **When** I click the “Generate phrase” button **Then** the system displays a generated sentence that reflects the provided input (e.g., includes at least one word from the input sentence) |

| Test case ||
| -------- | ------- |
| Actor |User|
| Expected Result | I can write an input sentence from which the application uses at least one word in each of the generated ones  |
| Result | When I write an input sentence and then press the submit button, the application generates random sentences using at least one word of the given one  |
| Test State | **Passed ✅** |

## Toxicity check of generated sentences

|Use case ||
| -------- | ------- |
| User Story | **As a** user, **I want** the program to check the toxicity of the generated sentences, **so** that I will only get appropriate content. |
| Description| The generator must check the toxicity of the generated sentences to protect the user from non politically correct content.  |
| Acceptance Criteria | **Given** I’m on the Random Sentence Generator app **When** I click the “Generate phrase” button **Then** the system generates a random sentence **And** the system automatically analyzes its toxicity **And** if the sentence is non-toxic, it displays the sentence in the output area **And** if the sentence is toxic, it discards it and generates a new one until a non-toxic sentence is produced **And** the user never sees a toxic sentence |

| Test case ||
| -------- | ------- |
| Actor |User|
| Expected Result | Each generated sentence has a confidence value, if it's higher than 0.5 the application generates another sentence to replace the previous one   |
| Result | When the application generates a new sentence, it checks the confidence value, if it's higher than  0.5 it generates a new one to replace the previous one, the process is recursive |
| Test State | **Passed ✅** |

## User selected sentence template

|Use case ||
| -------- | ------- |
| User Story | **As a** user, **I want** to select a template for the generated sentences, **so that** I receive random sentences following that template structure. |
| Description| The template defines the structure of the sentence. Once the user selects a template, all generated sentences will follow that specific structure.  |
| Acceptance Criteria | **Given** I’m on the Random Sentence Generator app **And** there is a list of available sentence templates **When** I select a template from the list **And** I click the “Generate phrase” button **Then** the system generates random sentences using the selected template structure |

| Test case ||
| -------- | ------- |
| Actor |User|
| Expected Result | I can select a sentence template from a list, and when I click the 'Generate phrase' button, the service will generate sentences based on that structure instead of using completely random ones. |
| Result | I selected a sentence template from a list, and when I clicked the 'Generate phrase' button, the service generated sentences based on that structure. |
