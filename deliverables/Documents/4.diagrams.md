# UML Diagrams

This page presents all the **UML diagrams** related to the project, along with a brief description of each and an explanation of their relationships.

## Domain Model
---
Based on the user stories, we developed the **Domain Model**, which illustrates the main high-level components used by the random sentence generator. This diagram outlines how the components are connected and how they collaborate.

## External Behavioral Model
---
Again starting from the user stories, we created the **External Behavioral Model**, which represents the system's interactions with external entities. A user interacts with our system, which in turn communicates with two external services: the **Syntax Analysis System** and the **Text Moderation System**. This diagram focuses on high-level inter-system communication.

## Cross-Subsystem Behavioral Model
---
Building upon the External Behavioral Model, we created the **Cross-Subsystem Behavioral Model**. Here, the internal system is decomposed into smaller components. This diagram shows the flow of communication between those internal subsystems and how they interact to handle various processes.

## Internal Behavioral Models
---
Using the **Domain Model** and the **Cross-Subsystem Behavioral Model** as a foundation, we developed the **Internal Behavioral Models**. These diagrams define the systemâ€™s internal classes and interfaces, detailing their methods and interactions. Each diagram corresponds to a specific external call made by the user.

## Design Class Model
---
Finally, combining insights from the Domain Model and Internal Behavioral Models, we created the **Design Class Model**. This diagram includes all system classes and interfaces, along with their methods and relationships. It also identifies which classes implement which interfaces.
